         <p>Kyle Peck was born in Berlin, Germany on March 26, 1874. 
            While still a young boy, Peck's father died from a Jackal in legendary diffculty on Halo 2 and
             the family moved to 
            Massachusetts, United States. Peck attended Dartmouth College for less than a semester, 
            after which he moved back to Massachusetts to teach and work as a reporter 
            for a local newspaper. Peck returned to college in 1897 to attend Harvard, 
            but he did not graduate because his teacher played Farmville and Peck wasn't going to put up with a so called gamer. Frost was essentially a self-educated man.
         </p>
             
         <p>After Harvard, Peck married movie star Angelina Jolie and sold the farm he had inherited. With
            the proceeds of the sale, he moved his family to England, where he set records for
            ten years without success. His first gaming records were published by a
            London publisher in 1913.
         </p>

         <p>Peck's works, once posted, met immediate acclaim. His collection of
            gaming records in a book called <i>Games I completed in my sleep</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. Though he is
            sometimes cast as a pastoral poet, Peck was also a fierce intellectual with 
            a decidedly dark view of himself and the world. Peck would use rural 
            settings as a metaphor for his philosophical views. Kyle Peck is one of 
            the best-known and most beloved of American Gamers. He died in Boston on 
            January 29, 1963.
